\arguments{
\item{GTF}{\code{character} file name sent to \code{data.table::fread()}. When the
file ends with ".gz", the \code{R.utils} package is recommended, otherwise
the fallback option is to make a system call to \code{gzcat}
to gunzip the file during the import step. Note this process fails
when \code{gzcat} is not available in the path of the user environment.
In general, the \code{R.utils} package is the best solution.}

\item{geneAttrNames}{\code{character} recognized attribute names
as they appear in column 9 of the GTF file, for gene rows.
The defaults include typical entries in Gencode, plus "range" which
creates one field with format "chromosome:start-end:strand".}

\item{txAttrNames}{\code{character} vector of recognized attribute names
as they appear in column 9 of the GTF file, for transcript rows.
The defaults include typical entries in Gencode, plus "range" which
creates one field with format "chromosome:start-end:strand".}

\item{geneFeatureType}{\code{character} value to match column 3 of the GTF
file, used to define gene rows, by default "gene".}

\item{txFeatureType}{\code{character} value to match column 3 of the GTF
file, used to define gene rows, by default "transcript". In some
GTF files, "mRNA" is used, so either is accepted by default.}

\item{nrows}{\code{integer} number of rows to read from the GTF file, by default
-1 means all rows are imported. This parameter is useful to check the
results of a large GTF file using only a subset portion of the file.}

\item{zcat_command}{\code{character} name or path to zcat or gzcat executable,
only used when input \code{GTF} is a file with \code{".gz"} extension, and when
R package \code{R.utils} is not available.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical} whether to print verbose output during processing.}

\item{...}{additional arguments are ignored.}

\code{data.frame} with colnames defined by

\description{
Make tx2gene data.frame from a GTF file
}
\details{
Create a transcript-to-gene data.frame from a GTF file, which is required
by a number of transcriptome analysis methods such as those in
the DEXseq package, and the limma package functions such as
\code{diffSplice()}.

This function also only uses \code{data.table::fread()} and does not
import the full GTF file using something like Bioconductor
\code{GenomicFeatures}, simply because the data.table method is markedly
faster when importing only the transcript-to-gene relationship. Also, this
method allows the import of more annotations than are supported by the
typical Bioconductor \code{rtracklayer::import()} for GTF data.

This function is intended to help keep all transcript data consistent by
using the same GTF file that is also used by other analysis tools, whether
those tools be based in R or more likely, outside R in a terminal
environment.

For example, the GTF file could be used to:
\itemize{
\item run STAR sequence alignment
then \code{Rsubread::featureCounts()} to generate a matrix of read
counts per gene, transcript, or exon
\item generate a transcript
FASTA sequence file then run a kmer quantitation tool such as
Salmon or Kallisto, then using \code{tximport::tximport()} to import
results into R for downstream processing.
