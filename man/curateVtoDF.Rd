\usage{
curateVtoDF(x, curationL = NULL, matchWholeString = TRUE,
  trimWhitespace = TRUE, whitespace = "_ ", expandWhitespace = TRUE,
  previous = NULL, verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{character vector as input}

\item{curationL}{list containing curation rules, as described above, or
a character vector of yaml files, which will be imported into
a list format using \code{yaml::yaml.load_file()}.}

\item{matchWholeString}{logical indicating whether to match the whole
string for each entry in \code{x}. If \code{matchWholeString=TRUE} then
the substitution patterns are all extended where needed, in order
to expand the pattern to match the whole string.}

\item{trimWhitespace}{logical indicating whether to trim leading and
trailing whitespace characters from \code{x}.}

\item{whitespace}{character vector containing whitespace characters.}

\item{expandWhitespace}{logical indicating whether substitution patterns
should be modified so any whitespace characters in the pattern will
match the defined \code{whitespace} characters. For example when
\code{expandWhitespace=TRUE}, the pattern \code{"_KO_"} will be modified to
\code{"[ _]+KO[ _]+"} so the pattern will match \code{" KO "} and \code{"_KO_"}.}

\item{previous}{optional data.frame whose colnames may be present as
names in \code{curationL}, or single vector with \code{length(previous)=length(x)}.
If \code{previous} is supplied as a data.frame, and the curation colname
is present in \code{colnames(previous)}, then unmatched substutition
patterns will retain the data in the relevant column of \code{previous}.
This mechanism allows editing single values in an existing column,
based upon pattern matching in another column.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether to print verbose output.}

\item{...}{additional arguments are ignored.}

\description{
Curate vector into a data.frame
}
\details{
This function is intended to curate a vector into a data.frame
with specifically assigned colnames. It is intended to be a more
generic method of curation annotations than splitting a characteer
string by some delimiter, for example where the order of annotations
may differ entry to entry, but where there are known patterns
that are sufficient to describe an annotation column.

That said, if annotations can be reliably split using a delimiter,
that method is often a better choice. In that case, this function
may be useful to make input data fit the expected format.

For example from \code{c("Sample1_WT_LPS_1hour", "Sample2_KO_LPS_2hours")}
we can tell whether a sample is \code{KO} or \code{WT} by looking for that
substring.

The \code{curationL} is a list with the following properties:
\itemize{
\item \code{names(curationL)} represent colnames to create in the output
data.frame.
\item each list element contains a list of two-element vectors
\item each two-element vector contains a substitution pattern and
substitution replacement
}

When \code{matchWholeString=TRUE} the substitution patterns are extended
to match the whole string, using parentheses around the main pattern.
For example if the pattern is "KO" and replacement is "KO", then the
pattern is extended to "^.\emph{KO.}$", so the entire string will be
replaced with "KO".

Typically, \code{curationL} is derived from YAML formatted files, and
loaded into a list with this type of setup:

\code{curationL <- yaml::yaml.load_file("curation.yaml")}.

The generic YAML format is as follows:

NewColname_1:
\itemize{
\item 
\itemize{
\item patternA
\item replacementA
}
\item 
\itemize{
\item patternB
\item replacementB
NewColname_2:
}
\item 
\itemize{
\item patternC
\item replacementC
}
}

\item 
\itemize{
\item KO|knockout|knock

      })),
   rep(c("WT", "Mut"), each=3),
   rep(c("Veh","EtOH"), 3),
   sep="_");
x;

curationYaml <- c(

cat(curationYaml)
curationL <- yaml::yaml.load(curationYaml);
